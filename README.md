# Sudoku-Solver-using-Genetic-Algorithm

The solver can take in a hard coded board or a randomly generated board   

Utilizes Uniform Crossover and Tournament Selection to optimize performance   

Mutatation rate = 0.2    


### Overall Process:

1. Generate n solutions (population)
1. Generate m new solutions (children) (reproduction)
1. Choose parents
1. Crossover + mutation
1. Choose N of the N+m solutions for new population (survival)
1. Repeat
